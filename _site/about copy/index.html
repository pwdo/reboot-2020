<h2>Nurture the people, nurture the community</h2>
<p>As engaged as our members are, we are all volunteers at the end of the day. But, by being with people who can help you nurture, we can help grow both you and the community.</p>
<p>Here are some of the plans we have so far. Maybe you can help us make this better!</p>
<ul>
<li>Roles with your personal goals</li>
<li>Volunteer by availability</li>
<li>Inclusive remote orientations</li>
<li>Quarterly Skillshares</li>
<li>Internal Trainings</li>
<li>Periodic Socials</li>
</ul>
